# Custom 3D Graphics Engine 

This repository hosts my Custom 3D Graphics Engine project, engineered using advanced rasterization techniques in C++ and OpenGL. The project showcases a blend of technical prowess and creative problem-solving, designed to optimize and elevate game development processes

## Project Overview

The heart of this project lies in its custom graphics engine, crafted to offer multiple rendering modes, optimized depth processing, and a step frame analysis feature. The engine is tailored for intricate rendering needs and complex visual effects, standing as a testament to the capabilities of modern graphical programming.

### Key Features:
- **Optimized Depth Processing:** Ensures accurate rendering of 3D spaces and objects.
- **Multiple Rendering Modes:** Offers versatility in visual representation, catering to various game development needs.
- **Step Frame Analysis:** A unique tool for developers to inspect and optimize each frame for performance and quality.
- **Support for Doom WAD Files:** Incorporates classic rendering techniques like BSP trees and occlusion maps, bringing a nostalgic feel with modern performance.

## Level Editor

A standout component of this project is the robust, user-friendly level editor. This tool revolutionizes the way developers and designers interact with game map creation, providing:

- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Simplifies the design process by allowing easy manipulation of objects and textures.
- **Customizable Map Design:** Users can tailor game maps to their specific vision, with intuitive controls and a wide range of options.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Rasterization Techniques
Utilizing advanced rasterization methods, the engine interprets and converts 3D models into 2D images, ensuring high performance and stunning visuals. This includes efficient handling of textures, lighting, and shadows, providing a lifelike gaming experience.

### OpenGL Integration
By leveraging OpenGL, the engine achieves cross-platform compatibility and harnesses the power of both hardware and software rendering. This integration allows for scalability and adaptability in various gaming environments.

### BSP Trees and Occlusion Maps
Borrowing from classic games like Doom, the engine implements Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) trees and occlusion mapping. These techniques optimize rendering by efficiently organizing data and reducing the rendering of unseen objects, enhancing both performance and gameplay experience.

## Project Status and Updates
- **Initial Engine Development:** The core engine, including depth processing and multiple rendering modes, was completed and rigorously tested.
- **Level Editor Launch:** The level editor was launched, featuring an intuitive interface and comprehensive design tools.
- **Doom WAD File Support:** Integration with Doom WAD files was implemented, bringing classic rendering techniques into the modern era.

## Future Plans
Looking ahead, the project aims to expand its capabilities with features like real-time lighting adjustments and AI-driven texture optimization. The goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in game development, providing tools that are not only powerful but also accessible to creators of all skill levels.

# Conclusion

This Custom Graphics Engine project represents a significant leap in game development technology. By combining advanced graphical techniques with user-friendly design tools, it opens up new horizons for game creators and enthusiasts alike. The project continues to evolve, driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to excellence in the field of game development.
